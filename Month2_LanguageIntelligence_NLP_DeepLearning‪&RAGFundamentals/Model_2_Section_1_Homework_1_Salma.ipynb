        "### 📝 Homework: Building Your First NLP Pipeline\n",
        "\n",
        "**Theory & Elaboration**\n",
        "This homework is your capstone for the week. You'll combine all the concepts we've discussed into a single, functional **NLP Pipeline**. This is one of the most common and essential tasks in all of Natural Language Processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **The NLP Pipeline (An Assembly Line for Text) 🏭**: Think of a pipeline as an assembly line for raw text. Messy, unstructured sentences go in one end, and each step on the line performs a specific, targeted transformation. The output of one step becomes the input for the next, until clean, structured, and useful data emerges at the end. The quality of your pipeline directly impacts the quality of your final analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **The Goal: Preparing for a \"Bag of Words\"**: The ultimate goal of this cleaning process is to prepare our text for a machine learning model. The output of your pipeline—a clean list of root words—is the perfect input for a foundational model called the **Bag of Words (BoW)**.\n",
        "    * **Analogy**: Imagine you take a book, tear out all the pages, cut out every single word, and throw them all into a giant bag. You then shake the bag, disregarding all grammar and sentence order. Finally, you create a frequency count of every unique word. That's a Bag of Words!\n",
        "    * This simple frequency model is surprisingly powerful and is the basis for tasks like **document classification** (e.g., spam vs. not spam) and **sentiment analysis**. Your pipeline is the essential first step to creating this model.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Why Order Matters**: As an engineer, the sequence of your pipeline is a critical design choice. A logical order is: `Lowercase -> Tokenize -> Filter -> Normalize`. This ensures, for example, that you lowercase words *before* checking them against an all-lowercase stop word list.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Your Challenge**\n",
        "Your task is to build a function, `preprocess_text`, that accepts a raw string of text. It must perform a series of normalization steps and return a list of cleaned, stemmed tokens, ready for a Bag of Words model.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Requirements & Hints:**\n",
        "* Your final list of tokens should be **lowercased**.\n",
        "* It should **not** contain any **punctuation**.\n",
        "* It should **not** contain any **stop words**.\n",
        "* Each word in the final list should be **stemmed** to its root form.\n",
        "* **Tools**: You will need to import and use `word_tokenize`, `stopwords` from `nltk`, and `string` from Python. You'll also need to initialize the `PorterStemmer`.\n",
        "* **Advanced Tip**: For a more elegant solution, see if you can perform the filtering and stemming steps inside a single list comprehension.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Bonus Challenge 🌟**\n",
        "Create a second function called `preprocess_with_lemma` that performs the same cleaning steps but uses **spaCy's lemmatization** instead of NLTK's stemming for the final normalization step.\n",
        "* **Hint**: You'll need to process the text with a spaCy `nlp` object to access the `.lemma_` attribute of each token. How can you integrate this with your existing filtering logic for stop words and punctuation?"
